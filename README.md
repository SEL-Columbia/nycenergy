NYC Energy Map
===============

The map represents an estimate of the total annual building energy consumption
at the block level and at the tax lot level for New York City, and is expressed
in kilowatt hours (kWh) per square meter of land area. A mathematical model
based on statistics, not individual building data, was used to estimate the
annual energy consumption values for buildings throughout the five boroughs.
To see the percentage break down of the estimated end-uses, hover over or click
on a block or tax lot. The tax lot level data shows how much energy an average
building of that size and type would use.
